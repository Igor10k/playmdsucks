#Playmdsucks

A Safari extension that replaces play.md's html5 player with simple `<video>` tag

## Why?

A few months ago lazy ignorant play.md developers did some changes to
their website that made it unusable in Safari. Somehow their HTML5 player
turns off the sound in OS X completely while video is playing. At first I
was like hell with it, but once in a while I still get links from my
friends to videos there so at some point I got sick of running other
browsers every time I want to watch a video there. Well, and also I wanted to
make a Safari extension for some time already. And here you have it. A shiny
new extension that can make your life a bit easier. Or maybe not.
